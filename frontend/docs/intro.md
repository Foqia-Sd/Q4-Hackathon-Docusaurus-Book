# Intro Humanoid Robotics

Let’s explore **AI-Native Humanoid Robotics**—the fusion of artificial intelligence, human-like embodiment, and autonomous decision-making—in a clear and structured way.

This book is designed to help you understand how **humanoid robots are built from the ground up**, not just as machines, but as intelligent systems capable of perception, learning, interaction, and adaptation.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by understanding the **core architecture of AI-Native humanoids**—how hardware, software, and intelligence work together.

You’ll gradually move from:
- Fundamental AI concepts  
- To humanoid body design  
- To cognition, ethics, and real-world applications  

Each chapter builds on the previous one, just like training an intelligent system.

### What you’ll need

- **Basic understanding of AI concepts** (machine learning, data, algorithms)
- **Interest in robotics and human–machine interaction**
- A mindset ready to explore the future of intelligent systems  

(No advanced robotics background is required—concepts are explained step by step.)

## Structure of This Book

This book follows an **AI-native approach**, meaning intelligence is not added later—it is the foundation.

You will learn about:
- Perception systems (vision, speech, sensors)
- Decision-making and learning models
- Humanoid motion and control
- Human-robot interaction
- Ethical and social implications of humanoid AI

Each section combines **theory, real-world examples, and conceptual models** to make learning intuitive.

## How to Use This Book

Read the chapters in sequence for a complete understanding, or jump to specific topics based on your interest.

As you progress:
- Revisit concepts like learning and autonomy—they evolve across chapters  
- Reflect on how AI-native humanoids differ from traditional robots  
- Think critically about their role in society  

This book is not just about **how humanoid robots work**, but **why they matter**.
